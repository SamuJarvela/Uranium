          <p> Tim Goyder's uranium explorer Northern Territory, Australia - 
New blood on the board: 
Marnie Finlayson (former Rio Tinto battery materials managing director)
 Matthew Yates (co-founder and Executive Chairman of OreCorp Limited,
leading it through to its acquisition by Perseus Mining for $280 million in 2024.)

New funding round in parts but approx. ~$35M AUD. No warrants, no RSUs to the board, only 6 million options exercisable at 0.23 AUD for a 3 year period.
There have been drillers in the Northern Territory but not nearly as many as in Athabasca. Well-known mines have been Jabiluka 307Mlbs 0.55% U3O8 and Ranger 300Mlbs 0.23% U3O8 and Nabarlek in the 1980s which produced 11,8 t ~24Mlbs 1.84% U3O8. I understood that the terrain for drilling is much better terrain than in Athabasca. When the rainy season ends in April, drilling will begin around Nabarlek
Devex has the largest drilling permit area in the Northern Territory. Devex has recently purchased Rio Tinto's exploration permit areas and Alligator Rivers application and granted licenses. (ARUP).
I don't own a position but when it comes down -30% (uranium usually comes) I'll take a slice. Only Australian or New Zealand citizens can participate in the current funding round.
Tried to keep my hands off the explorers but a little slice of Devex doesn't sound bad. </p>

          <p>"I believe the utilities over the last 15 years through predatory pricing through using the inventory as a bloody hammer and keeping prices down they virtually put the industry to its knees and the whole feature of that period was price. So then what you ended up is the industry that we have today. uh well you know before 2023 for sure we had people who couldnt raise money and they couldnt even raise money to finish off their feasibility study apart from few expections. So now the industry is not now for the utilities to say "oh you know somehow things will happen" they have to engage in security of supply they have to recapitalize the industry that has to be through higher prices of uranium because it is not just peaking out a little bit of production out  of paladin a little bit out of boss it is a whole new world production has to come with a whole muscled up supply sector and I see that supply sector is still a long way from actually becoming that and I dont see the sort of big multionationals coming in you know and say "oh we will try this uranium" where they got people and they got resources and so it's weaker than what people understand and then everybody sends to say "oh bloody borshoff you say" its a fact there is no industry as pummel as the supply sector 
no interest here that people left the industry and you've in the last 9 months your demand has gone up unbelievably and even if not all of that gets activated when you look at the supply sleepy hollow nothing is happened and I'm not talking about the paladins and the bosses these are and mcarthurs these are mothball projects that are just now replicating what mine production was in 2012 150 million pounds, not one of them is contributing to additive pounds you give the replacive pounds from the underfeeding that is evaporating. So where the hell is this new production going to happen? Which and in terms of "yeah i dont need any production from 2026 and I dont need any" bloody hell in terms of time 2030 is tommorow. In terms of mining in terms of getting organizing." -John Borshoff</p>
